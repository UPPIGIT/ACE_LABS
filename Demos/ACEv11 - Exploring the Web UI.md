ACEv11 - Exploring the Web UI


OVERVIEW 


This tutorial helps you explore the App Connect Enterprise Web UI which is used for administering installations of the software product. If you are not already familiar with the concept of an Integration Node and an Integration Server, you should start by looking through another tutorial named Getting Started with ACEv11 - Creating an Integration Server, which will help explain these concepts. 

The App Connect Enterprise Web UI contains slightly different options depending on whether you connect to an Integration Node, an Integration Server (which is defined independently from an Integration Node) or to an instance of the Web UI which is configured for the administration of multiple Nodes and Servers. This example uses a few simple flows to populate the WebUI enough to demonstrate the basics of it. 

In this tutorial you will deploy several message flows to Integration Servers (both those associated with an Integration Node and those which are independent) and you will then use the Web UI to view what has been deployed.
