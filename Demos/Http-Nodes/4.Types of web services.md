Types of web services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three most common types of web services that an Integration Bus developer encounters are SOAP web services, XML-RPC web services, and RESTful web services.

SOAP web services provided a standard XML message format and encoding rules. SOAP supports both remote procedure call and document style web services.


XML-RPC is an older form of a remote procedure style web service. Introduced in 1998, XMLRPC were popular with Microsoft and webMethods web service implementations.


Representational State Transfer (REST) models web services as server resources, instead of a set of procedures from a server application. REST services use the HTTP header and body as its message format. 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a common data format for REST messages.
