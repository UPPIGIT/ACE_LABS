When to use SOAP nodes? When to use HTTP nodes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use both SOAP message processing nodes and HTTP message processing nodes when you write message flows that use web services. When is it better to use one over the other?

If the messages you process are based on SOAP, it is better to use SOAP nodes and the SOAP domain. These provide more capability for handing SOAP messages than do HTTP nodes.SOAP nodes use a common SOAP message assembly, regardless of the content of the
message. 

SOAP nodes automatically handle SOAP with Attachment (SwA) and Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) messages, two common SOAP message
formats. At runtime the SOAP nodes can also check the messages against the WSDL that was used to create the message flow components.

If the messages are not based on SOAP, or if a message flow handles messages that use more than one WSDL, you can use HTTP nodes and the XMLNSC domain. This alternative is also best if your message flow interacts with multiple web services that use different standards.
