Deployment of Policies:
You can deploy the policy project either as part of the application in a single bar file or the policy project can be deployed separately as an independent bar file

Please note that if the policy name is set on a message flow or message flow node, one must deploy the policy before the message flow can be started.

Once the policies gets deployed, the deployed policies are shown in the run sub-directory of the integration work directory
