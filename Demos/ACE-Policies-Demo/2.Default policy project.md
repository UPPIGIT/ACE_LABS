Default policy project

Default policy project can be created in two ways
Using mqsicreateconfigurableservice
Using server.conf.yaml file.

I have already explained the process of policy creation using mqsicreateconfigurable service above (and its the least preferred option)

The other way to create policy file is by modifying the server.conf.yaml file that has certain properties related to it.
